# A set of defaults for the 'simplib' namespace

# $use_sssd
# Default: false on EL<6.7, true otherwise
#   There are issues with ldap and nslcd on EL7+ which can result in users
#   being locked out of the system. SSSD contains a bug which will allow users
#   with a valid SSH key to bypass the password lockout as returned by LDAP but
#   this can be worked around much more easily than the workaround for the ldap
#   issues which significantly weaken your security posture.
