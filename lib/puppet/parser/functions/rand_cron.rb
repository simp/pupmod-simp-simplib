module Puppet::Parser::Functions
  newfunction(:rand_cron, :type => :rvalue, :arity => -1, :doc => <<-'ENDHEREDOC') do |args|
    Provides a "random" value to cron based on the passed integer value.
    Used to avoid starting a certain cron job at the same time on all
    servers.  If used with no parameters, it will return a single value between
    0-59 first argument is the occurrence within a timeframe, for example if you
    want it to run 2 times per hour the second argument is the timeframe, by
    default its 60 minutes, but it could also be 24 hours etc

    Example:
      int_to_cron('100')     - returns one value between 0..59 based on the value 100
      int_to_cron(100,2)    - returns an array of two values between 0..59 based on the value 100
      int_to_cron(100,2,24) - returns an array of two values between 0..23 based on the value 100
